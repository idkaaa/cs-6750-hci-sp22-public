# Week 13

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## Distributed Cognition As A Theoretical Framework For Information Visualization

> Liu, Z., Nersessian, N., & Stasko, J. (2008). Distributed cognition as a theoretical framework for information visualization. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 14(6). (pp. 1173-1180).

Topic: authors argue that cognition is more of a property of interaction than a property of the human mind and that reductionist approaches to examine human minds are not as informative for information visualization design.

## The Aware Home: A Living Laboratory For Ubiquitous Computing Research

> Kidd, C., Orr, R., Abowd, G., Atkeson, C., Essa, I., MacIntyre, B., Mynatt, E., Starner, T. & Newstetter, W. (1999). The aware home: A living laboratory for ubiquitous computing research. In N. Streitz, S. Konomi, & H. Burkhardt (Eds.) Cooperative Buildings: Integrating Information, Organizations, and Architecture (pp. 191-198).

Topic: ubiquitous computing at home using HCI principles.

## Discovering Alternative Treatments For Opioid Use Recovery Using Social Media

> Chancellor S., Nitzburg, G., Hu, A., Zampieri, F., & Choudhury, M. (2019). Discovering Alternative Treatments for Opioid Use Recovery Using Social Media. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: examining homelessness on social media through analysis of data from Tumblr blog posts to realize practical applications of HCI to help underserved populations.

## Spaces And Traces: Implications Of Smart Technology In Public Housing

> Kozubaev, S., Rochaix, F., DiSalvo, C., & Le Dantec, C. (2019). Spaces and Traces: Implications of Smart Technology in Public Housing. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: investigating smart home technologies in the context of public housing as well as complex issues which arise (e.g., privacy and autonomy).

## Understanding Law Enforcement Strategies And Needs For Combating Human Trafficking

> Deeb-Swihart, J., Endert, A., & Bruckman, A. (2019). Understanding Law Enforcement Strategies and Needs for Combating Human Trafficking. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: interviewing officers who are combating human trafficking to understand how data can help. Author highlights key areas where HCI could help to improve:

1. Visualization of geospatial data
2. Usable security and privacy for unified databases
3. Archaic information systems used by law enforcement

## Serpentine: A Self-Powered Reversibly Deformable Cord Sensor For Human Input

> Shahmiri, F., Chen, C., Waghmare, A., Zhang, D., Mittal, S., Zhang, S., Wang, Y., Wang, Z., Starner, T., & Abowd, G. (2019). Serpentine: A Self-Powered Reversibly Deformable Cord Sensor for Human Input. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: self-powered sensor that can sense a variety of human input. Successful test results (97.7%) accuracy suggests that this sensor facilitate ubiquitous computing applications.

## The Parenting Actor-Network Of Latino Immigrants In The United States

> Wong-Villacres, M., Kumar, N., & DiSalvo, B. (2019). The Parenting Actor-Network of Latino Immigrants in the United States. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic: HCI (via Actor-Network Theory or ANT) to support parenting initiatives, particularly in education.

## The CHI Of Teaching Online: Blurring The Lines Between User Interfaces And Learner Interfaces

> Joyner, D. (2019). The CHI of Teaching Online: Blurring the Lines Between User Interfaces and Learner Interfaces. In E. Kapros & M. Koutsombogera (Eds.) Designing for the User Experience in Learning Systems, Human-Computer Interaction Series. Springer.

Topic: the intersection of interface design and learning design.

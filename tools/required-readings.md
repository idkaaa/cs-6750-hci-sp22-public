# Required Reading List (Spring 2022)

This class has two reading lists: a list of required readings, and a
list of recommended readings. The required readings will be useful to
your assignments and projects, and will also be tested more explicitly
on the two course tests. The recommended readings are more generally
foundational books, papers, and courses on HCI in general.

## Required Reading List

On average, you can expect to spend 1 to 2 hours reading per week. The
topics of these papers fall into two categories: some are thorough,
retrospective overviews of decades of HCI research; some are
foundational, seminal works in the field of HCI; and some are
cutting-edge research from the most recent HCI-related conferences and
journals.

The information contained in these readings will be useful as you
complete your assignments and projects, but it will also be tested
explicitly on the course tests. Ten questions on each test will be based
on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in
reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of
the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as
to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

Note that the weeks in this list represent the week of content most
relevant to the listed readings. However, we know that there will be
weeks when you are busier than others, and you may not be able to
complete a week’s readings during that particular week. The only
assessments dependent on having completed these readings are the tests,
so you need only worry about completing the readings by the date of the
next test.

We recommend reading [How to Read an Academic
Paper](http://omscs6460.gatech.edu/research-guide/how-to-read-an-academic-paper/)
from CS6460 to better understand how to fit some of these readings into
our estimated 1-2 hours per week.

## Recommended Reading List

HCI is a huge field, and there’s always more to read; in addition to the
required papers and chapters above, there are also several books, other
papers, and other courses online that we recommend checking out. None of
these are tested explicitly in any work required for the class, but they
would certainly benefit both your work here as well as your future
pursuits.

## Books

The following books are seminal HCI literature and could be read in
parallel to any course material.

## Papers

In addition to these books, there are several excellent readings that
complement specific lessons or concepts from HCI. Many of these papers
will be discussed during those lessons, but we have also provided a
[list of recommended
papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MnXmRSmilcNBb1FIvENWoKLBBTL9Jk68KhYjMhHzTZE/edit?usp=sharing)
and their corresponding lessons and topics. Where available, links go to
the paper; if a link is not available, you should be able to locate the
paper through the [Georgia Tech library](http://library.gatech.edu/) or,
if noted, the Files folder on Canvas.

## Courses

There are also a number of high-quality courses offered by other
instructors and institutions that may be of interest to further

# Week 2

> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

## User-Centered System Design: New Perspectives On Human-Computer Interaction

> Norman, D. A. (1986). Cognitive engineering. In D. A. Norman & S. W. Draper (Eds.) User-Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-Computer Interaction. (pp. 32-61). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

Topic:

1. To understand the fundamental principles behind human action and performance that are relevant for the development of engineering principles of design
2. To devise systems that are pleasant to use

Stages of user activities:

1. Establishing the goal
2. Forming the intention
3. Specifying the action sequence
4. Executing the action
5. Perceiving the system state
6. Interpreting the state
7. Evaluating the system state with respect to the goals and intentions

Prescriptions for design:

1. Create a science of user-centered design
2. Take interface design seriously as an independent and important problem
3. Separate the design of the interface from the design of the system
4. Do user-centered system design: Start with the needs of the user

Some terms from this section:

- **Cognitive engineering** - it is a type of applied Cognitive Science, trying to apply what is known from science to the design and construction of machines.
- **Design model** - the conceptual model held by the designer
- **User's model** - the conceptual model formed by the user
- **System image** - the image resulting from the physical structure that has been built

## Chapter 2: The Psychology Of Everyday Actions

> Norman, D. (2013). Chapter 2: The Psychology of Everyday Actions. In The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition. (pp. 37-73). Arizona: Basic Books.

Topic: psychology of everyday actions.

1. How do people select and then evaluate their actions?
2. Role of understanding and emotions: pleasure when things work smoothly and frustration when things do not work
3. How do the lessons in the chapter translate into principles of design?

We bridge the Gulf of Execution through the use of signifiers, constraints, mappings, and a conceptual model. We bridge the Gulf of Evaluation through the use of feedback and a conceptual model.

Seven stages of action:

1. Goal (form the goal) - what do I want to accomplish?
2. Plan (the action) - what are the alternative action sequences?
3. Specify (an action sequence) - what action can I do now?
4. Perform (the action sequence) - how do I do it?
5. Perceive (the state of the world) - what happened?
6. Interpret (the perception) - what does it mean?
7. Compare (the outcome with the goal) - is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?

Three levels of processing:

1. Reflective - the home of conscious cognition. As a consequence, this is where deep understanding develops, where reasoning and conscious decision-making take place
2. Behavioral - the home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns
3. Visceral - the most basic level of processing

Mapping processing with actions:

1. Reflective - planning and comparing
2. Behavioral - specifying and interpreting
3. Visceral - performing and perceiving

Seven fundamental principles of design:

1. Discoverability
2. Feedback
3. Conceptual model
4. Affordances
5. Signifiers
6. Mappings
7. Constraints

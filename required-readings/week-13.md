Topic: interviewing officers who are combating human trafficking to understand how data can help. Author highlights key areas where HCI could help to improve:

1. Visualization of geospatial data
2. Usable security and privacy for unified databases
3. Archaic information systems used by law enforcement

## The CHI of Teaching Online: Blurring the Lines Between User Interfaces and Learner Interfaces

- [Notes Source](https://github.com/stevenxchung/OMSCS-Notes/tree/master/CS%206750%20-%20HCI/Required%20Reading)
- Joyner, D. (2019). [The CHI of Teaching Online: Blurring the Lines Between User Interfaces and Learner Interfaces](https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/234504/files/folder/Required%20Readings). InÂ E. Kapros & M. Koutsombogera (Eds.) _Designing for the User Experience in Learning Systems_, Human-Computer Interaction Series. Springer.

Topic: the intersection of interface design and learning design.

- learning technology is affected by UI design
- UI is now
  - at center of student and teacher experience
    - instead of complementary
- classroom **is** a UI
- Synch vs async learning envs.
- Specify student (user) activities/actions when appropriate
- Similar: valued in UI design and learning design
  - rapid feedback
- Different:

  - learning could suffer if UI design is prioritized

- Two design paradigms support
  - immediate interaction
  - long-term learning gains

## Lessons 2.7 through 2.10

Design principles in general give us some great rules of thumb to use when creating our initial prototypes and designs.

- [2.7 - Task Analysis](2/07/2.7.md)

  - Task analysis allows us to describe those needs,
    - those tasks in formal ways to equip the interface design process, and cognitive load lets us keep in mind how much users are asked to do at a time.

  - [2.7.5 - Strengths and Weaknesses of GOMS](2/07/2.7.md#275---strengths-and-weaknesses-of-goms)
  - [2.7.8 - GOMS to Cognitive Task Analysis](2/07/2.7.md#278---goms-to-cognitive-task-analysis)
  - [2.7.13 - Cognitive Task Analysis Strengths and Weaknesses](2/07/2.7.md#2713---cognitive-task-analysis-strengths-and-weaknesses)

- Mental models provide us an understanding of how the design alternatives might mesh with the user's understanding of the task.
- [2.8 - Distributed Cognition](2/08/2.8.md)
  - Distributed cognition gives us a view on interface design that lends itself to design at a larger level of granularity.
  - Week 8 Readings
  - models or theories, of the context surrounding ACI

  - Other Theories
    - [2.8.10 - Social Cognition](2/08/2.8.md#2810---social-cognition)
      - how social connections create systems that can, together, accomplish tasks
    - [2.8.12 - Situated Action](2/08/2.8.md#2812---situated-action)
      - humans as improvisers
      - like distributed cognition, but
        - not interested in the long-term and enduring permanent interactions
      - Memory: recognition is easier than recall
    - [2.8.15 - Activity Theory](2/08/2.8.md#2815---activity-theory)
      - interaction between various pieces of an activity
      - very complex, predates HCI (HCI comes from it)
      - Three main contributions of Activity Theory
        1. Zooms out to activity (general) instead of task (specific). More abstract.
        1. Zooms out from low level operators to general user needs
        1. user actions can go higher or lower level on the hierarchy
- [2.9 Interfaces and Politics](2/09/2.9.md)
  - [2.9.9 - Value-Sensitive Design](2/09/2.9.md#299---value-sensitive-design)
    - Stakeholders (direct/indirect)
  - [2.9.13 - Exploring HCI: Interfaces and Politics](2/09/2.9.md#29-interfaces-and-politics)
    - Social Effects
- [2.10 Conclusion to Principles](2/10/2.10.md)
  - Human as:
    - Processor, Predictor, and Participant

    - Stephanie Chamberlain, Helen Sharp, and Neil Maiden
      - User-centered design:
        - At a minimum, user-centered design advocates involving users throughout the process through surveys, and interviews, and evaluations, and more things that we've already talked about.
        - high user involvement and close team collab
        - How feasible would it be to actually execute,
        - what would you need?
        - What users do you need?
          - How many?
          - When do you need them?
      - [3.8.8 - Approaches to User-Centered Design](3/08/3.8.md#388---approaches-to-user-centered-design)
        - Participatory design
          - all stakeholders are involved in design (not just source of data)
          - can be too focused on design team perspective
        - Action Research
          - done by the actual users
          - focuses more on others than participatory design
        - design-based research
          - can be done by outside practitioners (unlike action research)
  - Testing:
    - Live prototyping,
    - AB

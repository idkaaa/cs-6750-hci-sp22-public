> Ten questions on each test will be based on these readings. From the perspective of the test, your emphasis in reading these papers should be in getting a sufficient understanding of the material to answer high-level questions about the paper, as well as to be able to find answers quickly for more specific questions.

Topic: historical context for HCI.

- **User study** - in this book refers to an experiment with human participants
- HCI emerged in the 1980s, the discipline most central to HCI is _human factors_ or _ergonomics_

## Chapter 1: The Psychopathology Of Everyday Things

> Norman, D. (2013). Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things. In The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition. (pp. 1-36). Arizona: Basic Books.

Topic: psychopathology of everyday things.

Two of the most important characteristics of good design are _discoverability_ and _understanding_.

- **Industrial design** - the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
- **Interaction design** - the focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance peopleâ€™s understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction design draws upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience
- **Experience design** - the practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience
- Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology
- **Human-centered design (HCD)** - an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving
- Discoverability results from five fundamental psychological concepts: _affordances_, _signifiers_, _constraints_, _mappings_, and _feedback_; there is also another more important principle called _conceptual model_ of the system
- **Affordances** - are the possible interactions between people and the environment; some affordances are perceivable, others are not
- **Percieved affordances** - often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous
- **Signifiers** - signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done; signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function

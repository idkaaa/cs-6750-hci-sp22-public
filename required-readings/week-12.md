- Transfer Learning
  - Reuse trained ML models (transfer to new application)
  - Still mostly experts-only
    - curated (model zoos) domain-specific pre-trained toolkits
    - lots of subtasks
      - identify transfer candidates
      - successful transfer
      - performance eval
      - next step identification

![](assets/20220501121924.png)

- Study of non-expert behavior during transfer learning activities

  - focus on convolutional neural nets
    - identify object boundaries, colors and shapes in an image
    - transfer those to models
    - filters exposed as "layer" with features
      - "layer" would match novice user intuition better

- participants

  - self-selected via:
    - knowledge of reading and writing about/for a given domain
    - desire to learn about ML to complete a task (side-benefit)

- Empirical (Qualitative) observations

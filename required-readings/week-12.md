- Hackathons
  - Put on by organizers
    - Makerspace
    - Hackerspace
    - etc...
  - not just for nerds any more.
  - rapid prototyping resource for companies
- Program Theory
  - approach used to understand
    - processes
    - how to evaluate a program
  - ![](assets/20220501050207.png)
  - inputs
    - resources needed to initiate and complete a program
      - eg.
        - design materials or tools in hackathon
        - design challenge
  - process
    - activities that are conducted during program by participants
      - mechanisms are supported by activies
        - general principles that generate effects.
        - eg.
          - mid-session hackathon workshops to improve prototyping proficiency
            - could lead to better quality prototypes
  - effects
    - outputs
      - immediate tangible and intangible products of process
      - eg.
        - prototypes made during hackathon
    - outcomes
      - short and midterm
      - eg.
        - consequences, benefits or drawbacks of program
        - startup company made from hackathon idea
    - impacts
      - long term
      - hard to determine specific hackathon cause
      - eg.
        - hope and belonging by members
- Method of Analysis of papers
  - hackathon domain (edu, research, civic)
  - main organization approach for specific hackathon (choice of material)
  - reason for format modification
  - elements
    - input
    - process
    - output
